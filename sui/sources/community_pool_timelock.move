/// ZkWard Community Pool Timelock Module for SUI (DEFAULT CHAIN)
/// Optimized timelock controller for CommunityPool admin operations
/// 
/// SECURITY:
/// - 48 hour minimum delay for mainnet
/// - Multiple proposers (multisig recommended)
/// - Single executor (can be any address for permissionless execution)
/// - Gas-optimized batch operations
/// 
/// OPTIMIZATIONS:
/// - Batch scheduling/execution for lower gas costs
/// - Efficient storage with packed structs
/// - Lazy cleanup of expired operations
/// - Cached proposer validation
/// 
/// USAGE:
/// 1. Deploy timelock with proposers
/// 2. Transfer AdminCap to timelock
/// 3. All admin operations now require delay
